However, many of these articles do not necessarily follow best practices, especially in terms of security requirements. And there are also a number of gotchas along the way to keep an eye on.

      "text": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification problems. Data is mapped to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorised based in two dimensions. The algorithm creates an optimal hyperplane that divides the dataset into two classes, and then uses support vectors as its building block for classifying new data observations. Support vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane, meaning their influence is greater compared to other observations further away from the model boundary.<br/><br/><strong>sklearn</strong> provides a simple Python-based API to unlock the power of SVMs. This project demonstrates how a SVM can be used for binary classification, based on a Kaggle dataset.",
