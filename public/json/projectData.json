The program dynamically reads in city data from a file and calculates the shortest distance it can find, linking all cities. The actual physical distance on the route, calculated as the Haversine distance, is also shown. Specifiable genetic algorithm parameters include the crossover rate, mutation rate, population size, max. no. iterations and elitism generation gap.",

The classifier based on transfer learning boosts the accuracy of the somewhat limited dataset to nearly 100%, and additionally manages to train more quickly in only a handful of epochs.",
