The program dynamically reads in city data from a file and calculates the shortest distance it can find, linking all cities. The actual physical distance on the route, calculated as the Haversine distance, is also shown. Specifiable genetic algorithm parameters include the crossover rate, mutation rate, population size, max. no. iterations and elitism generation gap.",

      "text": "Artificial neural networks operate on a highly non-linear model and are typically described as \"black boxes\". This project is an attempt to peer into the black box model by visualising the weight changes affecting the hidden neurons, as well as the hidden neuron matrices themselves. A simple three-layer feedforward neural network was set up to differentiate between two classes of images: cartoons and photographs. From this study it became clear that there appears to be a general visual pattern to the hidden matrices of each of the image sets provided.",

The simpler CNN makes use solely of the provided dataset, whereas the other CNN additionally benefits from the application of the weights from a pre-trained model in the process of transfer learning. The classifier based on transfer learning boosts the accuracy of the somewhat limited dataset to nearly 100%, and additionally manages to train more quickly in only a handful of epochs.",
