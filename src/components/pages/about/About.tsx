            As a software engineer with experience in developing web-based applications
            at enterprise level,
            I am comfortable working in both the front and back end of an application.
            Most of what I do is focused around the use of Java and the Spring Framework,
            although I do appreciate the flexibility that JavaScript and Python bring to the table.
            That said, I tend to be language-agnostic, favouring the use of the most suitable
            tool for the job.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to my professional work, I have a keen interest in the field of
            machine learning, a journey I embarked on through my master&apos;s degree studies.
            The advent of TensorFlow and Keras have made it so much easier and faster to
            create and test models.
            I am constantly amazed at the ability these frameworks provide to
            extract meaning from data.
            And in a way, visualising the invisible has been something of a passion for me.
