            As a software engineer with experience in developing web-based applications,
            I am comfortable working in both the front and back end of an application.
            A lot of what I do is focused around the use of Java and the Spring Framework,
            often in conjunction with a front end framework such as Angular or React.
            That said, I tend to be language-agnostic, favouring the use of the most suitable
            tool for the job.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to my professional work, I have a keen interest in the field of
            machine learning, a journey I embarked on through my master&apos;s degree studies.
            The advent of TensorFlow and Keras have made it much easier and faster to
            create, train and test models.
            I am constantly amazed at these frameworks&apos; ability
            to easily extract meaning from complex data.
            It is exactly this rationale that ties in
            with that of my own computational explorations: visualising the invisible.
